# Real-Time Graph using C++ OpenGL and GLUT

This project creates a real-time graph using C++ with OpenGL and GLUT. The graph draws data from an Arduino sensor via serial communication. The graph updates dynamically as new data is received from the sensor, providing a visual representation of the sensor readings over time.
